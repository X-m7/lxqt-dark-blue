# Dark Blue Theme for LXQt

Based on the dark theme included with LXQt (in https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt-themes), but with the red accents changed to blue (roughly based on the blue from the KDE 5 Breeze theme), and not including the wallpaper.

## How to install

Put the dark-blue folder inside `~/.local/share/lxqt/themes/` to install for your user only, or in `/usr/share/lxqt/themes/` for all users.
